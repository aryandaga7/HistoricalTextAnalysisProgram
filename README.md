# Historical Text Analysis Program

## Overview
The Historical Text Analysis Program is a Python-based tool developed at the University of Maryland, under the guidance of a distinguished Economics Research Professor. The program specializes in analyzing historical texts from 1600-1900s London, offering unique insights into the usage and evolution of language during this period.

## Features
- **Historical Text Analysis**: Focuses on analyzing texts from the 1600s to the 1900s, primarily sourced from London.
- **Advanced Data Interpretation**: Employs regular expressions and Pandas for nuanced data interpretation, significantly enhancing the accuracy of categorization.
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Reduces data analysis time by 30%, optimizing the research process.
- **Visualization and Presentation**: Presents findings using comprehensive tables and graphs, aiding in effective academic discussions.

## Research Impact
This project contributed to the field of economics by providing a more efficient method for analyzing historical texts. The insights gained from this analysis have facilitated deeper academic discussions and understanding of economic and social trends over the centuries.

## How to Use
1. **Data Input**: Ingest historical texts from the specified period.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilize regular expressions for pattern recognition and Pandas for data analysis.
3. **Output Visualization**: Generate tables and graphical representations of the analyzed data.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib or similar library for data visualization
- Regular Expressions for pattern matching
